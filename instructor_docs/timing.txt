# Clio 2017-09

## Day 1

09:23-09:45 Initial bottles exercise. We decided, since they read the book, they
should only have 20 minutes to do the initial bottles exercise. Future classes
should only get 15 minutes.

09:45-10:02 Break

10:02-10:10 Course explanation

10:10-10:43 Collect goals

10:43-11:47 Bottles show and tell

13:00-14:25 Mob DRY bottles

14:25-14:35 Break

14:35-15:15 They do DRY bottles refactoring. They did this quickly and well. 20
minutes would have been enough. Most groups switched typists.

15:15-15:30 Break

15:30-16:30 Discuss DRY bottles, mob DRY to extract class

## Day 2

09:00-09:35 Surveys and discussion about Day 1. They had a better understanding
of the book material than previous classes who claimed to have read the book.
So, the push back for Day 1 was that it was too slow. A couple of suggestions
and thoughts that came out of it. Organize the initial pairings based on how
well they understood the book, not on Ruby experience. At the very beginning of
class, ask them to define shameless green, then only give them 10 minutes to
write shameless green for bottles, without using the book as a guide. This will
give us some feedback about how well they've understood the material. Then, we
can skip show and tell, or at least spend less time on it. If we skip it, we
need to find a place in the outline to discuss transformation priority premise
and other concepts that usually get introduced during show and tell. They also
only need 15-20 minutes to DRY verse. This will provide us even more feedback
about how well they've understood the book material.

09:35-10:10 They work on reflection presentations. They asked for 5 extra
minutes.

10:10-10:57 They give reflection presentations.

10:57-11:15 Break

11:15-11:45 They do extract class. Discussion time plus 20 minutes to do ther
refactoring.

11:45-12:15 Discussion. Ad hoc discussion about refactoring big apps that seemed
really useful, and was.

12:15-12:50 Lunch

12:50-14:00 Mob refactor: successor, conditional to polymorphism. I probably
forgot to log the timing for a break.

14:00-15:05 SOLID

15:15-17:00 Mob verse template refactoring, long follow on discussion

## Day 3

09:00-09:25 Surveys

09:25-10:30 Reflection

10:30-10:38 Discussion of today's schedule

10:38-10:50 Break

13:52-14:05 Break

14:00-15:45 House. They wanted an all-class explanation to get them around the
corner of extracting phrases, which took some time. At 15:05 we started
explaining order, composition, where inheritance goes wrong. At about 15:25 they
started working on it.
